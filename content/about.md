I was born in Ukraine and have been living in Germany since 2008. I earned a Master of Science in Chemistry from Goethe University, where I specialized in chemoinformatics for my master’s thesis.

In recent years, my work has focused on predictive maintenance, where I develop robust machine learning solutions to enhance system performance and reliability. I have extensive expertise in machine learning and data-driven problem-solving, with a strong track record of delivering impactful projects.

Beyond my work, I am passionate about community engagement and knowledge sharing. I enjoy helping others solve problems with code, and my contributions to the programming community have earned me a Gold Python Badge on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8973620/mykola-zotko). Supporting others and exchanging ideas is an integral part of who I am, both professionally and personally.

Currently, I reside in Wächtersbach, a charming town near Frankfurt. I stay active through inline skating, walking, and fitness, and I love experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
